SecondScreen
============

Socket Server Demos and Slides from JQueryTO

## Synopsis
A web framework for handling socket requests and incorporating second screen experiences into your applications.

##Installation
1. Clone Repo
2. Install Node
3. Install NPM
4. Run npm install from main directory
5. Point a simple webserver to the root directory

##Running
Run "node app.js" in terminal to begin the socket's server side component. You can also run forever app.js to keep an app running after you close the session. 

##Building Your Own Demos
Copy the "demos/boilerplate" directory to give yourself a good base to begin work. Don't forget to restart your app if you made changes to app.js

##Common Problems
Make sure your firewall isn't blocking the port being used (default is 7777). If you are using AWS you will have to open that port in the security settings.
